Based on the information gathered for John Doe, here are the detailed recommendations for his retirement plan:

1. **Increase Contributions**: 
   - Given John Doe's current age of 55 and his retirement horizon, it would be beneficial to maximize his contributions to take advantage of compounding returns. The current contribution of $20,000 AUD is a good start, but increasing this amount can significantly boost his retirement savings. Consider contributing the maximum allowed under concessional contributions which is $27,500 AUD per year (as of the current financial year) to reduce taxable income and enhance retirement savings.

2. **Review Performance**:
   - The performance returns for the past two years were 6% for 2022-2023 and 7% for 2021-2022. While these returns are relatively stable, it is crucial to periodically review the performance of the investments. John should consider diversifying his portfolio if it is not already diversified. This can help mitigate risks and potentially improve returns. Consulting with a financial advisor to review the asset allocation and investment strategy could provide insights into optimizing the portfolio for better performance.

3. **Consider Non-Concessional Contributions**:
   - If John has additional funds to invest, he may consider making non-concessional contributions (after-tax contributions). The current cap for non-concessional contributions is $110,000 AUD per year, or he can bring forward up to three years’ worth of contributions ($330,000 AUD) if he is under 67 years of age. This strategy can significantly increase his superannuation balance, provided he is within the total superannuation balance cap of $1.7 million AUD.

4. **Plan Retirement Age**:
   - Planning the retirement age is crucial for setting clear financial goals. If John plans to retire at 65, he has 10 more years to contribute and grow his retirement savings. If his goal is to retire earlier or later, adjustments to his contribution levels and investment strategy may be necessary. Creating a detailed retirement plan, considering factors like desired retirement lifestyle, expected expenses, and potential healthcare costs, will help in setting a realistic retirement age and financial targets.

By implementing these recommendations, John Doe can enhance his retirement savings and be better prepared for a financially secure retirement. It is also advisable for John to regularly review his retirement plan and make adjustments as needed, considering any changes in his financial situation or retirement goals.
